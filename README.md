https://livebetter.netlify.app/ 

Productivity App for who likes to be organized.

**TASK MYSELF IN THIS PROJECT:**

 Build an App that users can calculate their daily calorie needs with diet page, plan their days with to-do page, make their fitness program with the moves specified by us at the fitness page and lastly If they want to be motivated they can go to the motivation page and see motivational quotes from the successful people.

**What was the best practices for me in this project:**

I have used React Hooks such as useState, useContext, useEffect and useRef. Also I have used React Router v6. I have fetch the motivational quotes from an API with axios. For to-do page Iâ€™ve used Local Storage to store the data. I have used Framer-Motion for simple animations. Lastly I have used TailwindCss for styling.
